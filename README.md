## Git bisect exercise

### Note

This repo is based on https://github.com/bast/git-bisect-exercise, according to its license.

### Motivation

The motivation for this exercise is to be able to do archaeology with Git on a
source code where the bug is difficult to see visually. **Finding the offending
commit is often more than half the debugging**.


### Background

The script `get_pi.py` approximates pi using terms of the Nilakantha series. It
should produce 3.14 but it does not. The script broke at some point and
produces 3.57 using the last commit:

```
$ python get_pi.py

3.57
```

At some point within the 500 first commits, an error was introduced. The only
thing we know is that the first commit worked correctly.


### Your task

Clone or fork this repository and use `git bisect` to find the commit which
broke the computation.


### How to find the first commit

```
$ git log --oneline | tail -n 1
```


### Bonus exercise

Write a script that checks for a correct result and use `git bisect run` to
find the offending commit automatically.


### Solutions (spoiler alert!)

The offending commit is commit number 137.

And here is a Python script which can be used together with `git bisect run`
to find the offending commit automatically:

```python
import subprocess
import math
import sys

output = subprocess.check_output(['python', 'get_pi.py'])
result = float(output)

if math.isclose(result, 3.14):
    sys.exit(0)
else:
    sys.exit(1)
```

But you can also try to solve this using a shell script or a script
in your favourite language.
